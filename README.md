## SALES FORECASTING FOR SUPERSTORE SUPERMARKET

### INTRODUCTION

Superstore is a very large supermarket based in the United States of America with presence in all the states. They are best known for sale of office supplies, furniture and Technology supplies such as phones. Using Historical data, the company wants to forecast their future sales so as to plan and make informed decisions about future operations, marketing, and resource allocation.

Accuracy in sale predictition helps firms to adjust their strategy accordingly, anticipate future demand and identify potential problems or opportunities. Sale forecasting is a very key task that businesses need to embrace.

### OBJECTIVES

Superstore want to strategize their inventory management, logistics, production and manpower planning for the future. The objective of this project is to forecast future sales data by training supervised machine learning models on historical data.

### DATA UNDERSTANDING

#To remove noise in our dataset by resampling. 
Where you decrease the frequency of the sales, such as from days to months
#Visualizing the monthly sales dataset using lineplot

**Checking for Trend**
**Checking for trend using rolling mean**
rolling_mean = monthly_data.rolling(window=6).mean()

Since the p-value is 0.00020180198458237758 ,which is less than 0.05 we conclude that the data is stationary


# MODELLING

### ARIMA Model

### Findings
Based on the provided analysis, the model evaluation metrics for the three models are as follows:

**ARIMA Model:**

Best ARIMA Order: (0, 1, 1) AIC: 505.25 MSE: 1707.47 RMSE: 41.32

PMDARIMA Model: AIC: 387.39 MSE: 1640.99 RMSE: 40.51 Facebook Prophet Model:

MSE: 2544.91 RMSE: 50.45 Given the MSE and RMSE values, the PMDARIMA model is the best model because it has the lowest MSE and RMSE values.Arima Model is the second best model then followed by Facebook Prophet model. Facebook prophet model on the other hand, has higher MSE and RMSE values, indicating higher prediction errors compared to the ARIMA models.

Therefore, based on the provided metrics,PMDARIMA model is the best choice for this specific forecasting task. Further analysis and consideration of additional factors could help make a more informed decision.

## Recommendations
This study recommends: Increased use of digital marketting strategy to promote sales in future.
The sales team should also consider discounts in future so as to entice customers thereby increasing sales. Since there is probability of decline in sales in the future, the Company should avoid overstocking. Further analysis and consideration of additional factors could help make a more informed decision.
